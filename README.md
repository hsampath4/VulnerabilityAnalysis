# DiscoverFredericton

Discover Fredericton is an application designed to let users book two tours, Winter Tour and Summer Tour.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the programming language. I used SonarQube as a static
code analysis tool to ensure high-quality code because it can analyze code written in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

The application features a user login page, which allows users to register and login. Once logged in, users
can access the main features of the application, which include booking two different city tours - a winter
tour and a summer tour. After selecting the tour, users can book using a form provided. User gets a booking
confirmation ID which can be printed. After static code analysis using SonarQube, the resulting report
exposed 15 Bugs, 0 Vulnerabilities, 0 Code Smells, 0 Security Hotspots and 0 Duplications.
